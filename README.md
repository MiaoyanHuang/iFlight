FYP(Final Year Project 2023) - Project
Android Mobile Application

Hi there. Thanks for accessing my GitHub repository. This project was developed mainly using the Java programming language. The main functions include airfare comparison, flight tracking, and weather forecasting.

By the way, this project has been nominated as one of the best projects by my university.

I wrote a paper based on this project and submitted it to the IEEE Conference. However, the conference is still in progress, and I believe that my paper will be publicly available soon.

If you are interested in my paper, here is some information for you:

* Paper Title: Empowering Travelers with Airfare Comparison, Flight Tracking, and Real-Time Weather Forecasts on Android
